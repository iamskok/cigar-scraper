# TypeScript and Node.js Best Practices

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants and enum values
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Prefix private properties and methods with an underscore (_)

## 2. Code Structure
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle: each function or class should have a single, well-defined purpose
- Use interfaces to define object shapes and function signatures
- Organize code into modules and use import/export statements
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations instead of callbacks
- Utilize TypeScript's strict mode and enable all strict type-checking options

## 3. Documentation
- Use JSDoc comments for functions, classes, and complex code blocks
- Include a README.md file with project setup instructions and basic usage examples
- Document API endpoints, including request/response formats and authentication requirements
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## 4. Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for error handling in synchronous code
- Implement proper error handling for asynchronous operations using try-catch with async/await
- Create custom error classes for specific error types
- Log errors with appropriate severity levels and contextual information
- Avoid swallowing errors silently; always handle or propagate them

## 5. Performance
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient operations
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries and use indexing where appropriate
- Utilize connection pooling for database connections
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Use streaming for handling large files or data streams

## 6. Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) in environment variables
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Keep dependencies up-to-date and regularly check for vulnerabilities

## 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for individual functions and components
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints and complex workflows
- Use mocking for external dependencies in tests
- Aim for high test coverage, but focus on critical paths and edge cases
- Run tests automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline

## 8. Version Control
- Use descriptive commit messages following a consistent format (e.g., conventional commits)
- Create feature branches for new development and use pull requests for code reviews
- Keep the main/master branch stable and deployable at all times
- Use semantic versioning for releases

## 9. Code Quality
- Use a linter (e.g., ESLint) and formatter (e.g., Prettier) to maintain consistent code style
- Perform regular code reviews to ensure quality and knowledge sharing
- Refactor code when necessary to improve readability and maintainability
- Avoid code duplication; use utility functions or services for shared functionality

## 10. Dependency Management
- Use a package manager (npm or yarn) consistently throughout the project
- Keep dependencies up-to-date, but be cautious with major version upgrades
- Minimize the number of dependencies and prefer well-maintained, popular packages
- Lock dependency versions to ensure consistent builds

## 11. Configuration Management
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
- Use a configuration management library to handle different environments (development, staging, production)

## 12. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement structured logging for easier parsing and analysis
- Use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error) consistently
- Set up monitoring and alerting for critical system metrics and errors
- Implement distributed tracing for microservices architectures

These guidelines cover a comprehensive set of best practices for TypeScript and Node.js development, addressing various aspects of software development from code structure and style to security and performance considerations.
